## HTTP JSON API NODE.js Time Server

## Introduction
Objective: Create a JavaScript script to enable a Node.js server to send specific data to the client.
Overview: We will develop a Node.js script that facilitates communication between the server and client, allowing the server to transmit predefined data upon client request.
Purpose: This endeavor aims to demonstrate the capability of Node.js in serving dynamic content and responding to client queries efficiently.

## Design
This script creates a HTTP  time server using Node.js. When executed, it initializes an HTTP server that listens for incoming requests. Upon receiving a request, the server responds with the current date and time in the format "YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm". The server runs on the port specified as a command-line argument.
